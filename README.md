Tank 3D scene interactive game
This project is a light military style as the theme of the 3D scene exploration game, around the military cartoon style, with basic user control functions and a complete UI navigation system. After entering the game, the user will first see a main menu interface, which contains buttons such as "Start game", "Scene Browse", "Producer", "Edit Mode" and "Help", all of which are presented in light blue buttons, which are uniform and easy to identify.

Click "Start" to enter the main game scene, where the user can manipulate the tank model in a beautifully constructed terrain. The player can use on-screen buttons to move, rotate and scale the tank, or click the "Reset" button to restore it to its original state. The main scene also contains a wealth of static elements, such as walls, Bridges, flags, ships, warplanes and natural environments, creating a cartoon military environment with a relaxed and strategic atmosphere.

The whole project adopts clear user interface design specifications, intuitive and clear button layout, reasonable control grouping logic, such as "MOVE" and "ROTATE" instructions are equipped with directional arrows, to help users understand the control mode. All buttons provide visual feedback when hovering and clicking, further enhancing the perceptibility of the operation and allowing users to participate more directly in the scene interaction.

This project gives consideration to both teaching and playability. Users can not only explore the scene structure, but also manipulate and practice objects. It is suitable for grey box prototype, learning interactive logic and demonstrating design thinking.
